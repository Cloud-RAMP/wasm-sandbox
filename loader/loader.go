package loader

// load user code and compile it to a WASM binary here
// Consider supporting multiple languages (AssemblyScript, Rust, Go, whatever compiles to wasm)

// Will probably need to store wasm builds in web file storage
// Once we load them, we can keep them in memory (maybe a cache with an LRU policy)
